A hospital has a number of operating rooms and a number of different types of procedures that it performs. Not every operating room is suitable for each procedure and procedures may take longer or shorter, depending on their properties and the properties of the operating room in which it is scheduled. the objectif here is to create a program that assigns procedures to operating rooms in such a way that the total time it takes to perform the procedures is minimized.
